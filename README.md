Nowadays, digital business platforms are very popular and save us much effort and time in our daily life.
In order to stand out in the digital business trend of catering industry and provide more satisfying service, we designed this "FOODHUT " project.
Customers usually expect fast delivery and food in good condition to eat. So, in order to adapt to customers’ expectation and earn more profit for the restaurant owner,
we improved the traditional digital business platform. The online food ordering system provides convenience for the customers. 
It overcomes the disadvantages of the traditional queuing system. This system increases the takeaway of foods than visitors. 
Therefore, this system enhances the speed and standardization of taking the order from the customer. It provides a better communication platform.
